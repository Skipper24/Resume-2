Dear Team Looking to Hire a Data Scientist,  
&nbsp;  
I am exploring new career opportunities in the Houston area, and your LinkedIn job posting for a Data Scientist position certainly caught my eye!  I just want to take a moment to mention some of my qualitites and experience that I can match with your job description and that you might find useful for your team.

1. I earned my Master's degree from a top Applied Math department.  
2. Signal processing and time frequency analysis is a daily part of my current job function.  
3. I am very comfortable with various programming languages including R and Matlab, and have some experience with C++.  Python and Fortran are some of my strong languages as well; I have worked on High Performance Computing problems with Fortran, and I have recently been building an algorithmic currency trading system in my free time.  
4. I have studied various data science problems and machine learning algorithms, some of which I learned about in school, and some I picked up on my own personal time and research.

I have attached my resume as the second page to this pdf file for you to look over as well.  I would sure like for us to learn more about each other over a phone call.  I can be reached quickly by email to set up a time for a phone conference.  Please find my contact info in the header above.  Thank you very much for your time and consideration!

Best Regards,  
Cory Robinson
