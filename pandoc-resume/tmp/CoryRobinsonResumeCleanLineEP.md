Data Processing Geophysicist
:  *[SEIMAX Technologies](http://seimaxtech.com/) - Houston, TX*
  __Nov 2014 - Present__
* work in a team environment to clean up and process raw seismic data so that the data will be usefull for other geoscientists to analyze and interpret it mainly for hydrocarbon exploration  
* use GIS tools for analyzing the surface landscape which is helpfull in drawing inferences about subsurface structures to ensure that our data is being modelled correctly  
* designing software work flows full of signal processing and other advanced math methods and algorithms to build high quality subsurface images of the Earth.  
* communicate with other data processors about solving problems with messy data, speeding up computer runtimes for larger datasets, and talking with the software developers about bugs in programs or requirements for building new programs.

### Technical Experience

Academic Project
:  *Fractal Dimension of Time Series Data*
__Jan 2014 - Jun 2014__

*	independent work I completed as a requirement of my graduate program; gave a 30 minute presentation  
*	useful for finding periods of trending & volatility in financial time series data, and as a trading indicator  
*	used R for analysis and running simulations and visualizations

Side Projects
:	*Amateur Programming, Data Science, and Research*
  __Jun 2014 - Present__
*	using Python to build/program an algorithmic trading system for currency trading  
*	anomoly detection & spatial clustering of city crime data over time  
  *	built a web scraper to automatically download nearly a hundred Excel files (from the City of Houston's website) and merge the data into one file that I could more easily use for analysis
*	image alignment and text segmentation -- arose from a job interview problem that I was asked to work on at home
  *	build a computer program that takes an iPhone picture of a shopping receipt, automatically rotate so that it is aligned perfectly, and extract the text so that the program can print out each line item on the receipt and its dollar amount.
*	economic & policy data analysis with a focus on dissecting the 2016 presidential candidate's policy proposals
